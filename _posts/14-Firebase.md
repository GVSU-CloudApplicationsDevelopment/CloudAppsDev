## Firebase

You will most likely have come across Firebase if you have ever dipped into the mobile or web development scene.  You can read all about its fascinating history (it used to be called Envolve) at various blogs ([here](https://hackernoon.com/introduction-to-firebase-218a23186cd7) and [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/firebase-introduction/)), but what we are mainly interested in is how we can use it and how it can apply to cloud applications.

One important consideration is that Firebase is a group of services that can be used for backend development.  We won't be going into every single service that is offered (there are a lot), but will be looking into a handful that can be useful for you (and will point you towards resources that are helpful if you want to explore more).  Figure X shows the current list of services (as of Feb. 2021 anyway) that are supported by Firebase:

You might notice some crossover with the Google Cloud services we've seen so far (e.g., Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions, and Cloud Firestore).  These products actually share a common infrastructure and as such are used by both technologies.  An advantage here is that you can save time by already being embedded within the ecosystem of either Google Cloud or Firebase; concepts like access control and billing are the same.  The disadvantage though is that you're tied to a particular ecosystem and it can be difficult to diversify yourself if need be (though you can still do things like reach out to third-party providers via Cloud Functions, for example).  More detail can be found [here](https://firebase.google.com/firebase-and-gcp/).  

> Generally though, if you're looking to make a mobile/web app you may want to start with Firebase, and if you're looking to work on the backend of some product you'll most likely start with Google Cloud (or similar).

Here is a quick overview of how Cloud Functions can tie in with Firebase:

The following image shows off some quick guides for various platforms.  Note that we're stepping outside our comfort zones here! You can set this up with Unity, with iOS, even with C++!  How nifty!
