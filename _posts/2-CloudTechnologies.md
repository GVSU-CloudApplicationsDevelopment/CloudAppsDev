## Cloud Technologies

The benefit of using cloud technologies are that you are effectively using somebody else's servers.  The downside is that you are limited to the technologies supported by that provider.  For instance, you will probably be hard-pressed to try and use BigQuery (Google-specific technology for sifting through massive datasets) on DigitalOcean.  However, you may not need that technology!  (Again, consider all tradeoffs when selecting a provider).  

Since we are using Google Cloud for this course, we are going to focus on the technologies supported by Google.  Here is a page with the [full list of Google Cloud services](https://cloud.google.com/products).

*For reference, here are the products supported by [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/products/) and [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/)*.

You will notice a lot of overlap!  Consider that each are competing for *cloud dominance* and that each provider wants *you* to pay for their service.


ASSIGNMENT: WRITEUP 5 SERVICES

### Virtual Machines

One of the more common cloud services that are available are virtual machines.   These are effectively computers that you can setup that are accessible anywhere you have a network connection (and the necessary technology to access it -- for Google Cloud it is simply a browser).
