## Cloud Automation

Now bear with me...

*What if*...we...turned our infrastructure into code?

Well, we can!  Let's take the requirements that we need for an infrastructure (servers, VMs, etc.) and turn them into code-based templates (that can be both read by humans and machines).  By turning our needs into templates, we can very easily create the environments required to run our core processes up on the cloud.  

A nice bonus is that you can track such templates in revision control systems (e.g., git, subversion, etc.) as your needs adapt.  It should also go without saying, but if you create a template then you can very quickly spin up new resources in the event of a disaster, even automatically.

So, time to talk about [Cloud Deployment Manager](https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/).
