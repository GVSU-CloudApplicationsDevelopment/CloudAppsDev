## Machine Learning

Just as a precursor/forewarning: *this is not an in-depth guide to machine learning (ML) or artificial intelligence*!  We're going to use the tools available to us in Google Cloud, but for a deep dive into ML theory you'll probably want to take a whole class or post-graduate program on it.

Enough preamble, on we go!

### Machine Learning Basics

This is my favorite image related to machine learning, bar none (c/o CloudSight):

To you, clearly they are all muffins.  (joking).  But a machine learning algorithm might have a hard time telling the difference!  What about a traffic light covered in snow?  Or the side of a semi-truck that an algorithm recognizes as sky (see: Tesla disasters).

Let's start with an [overview of machine learning (3:47)](https://youtu.be/l95h4alXfAA)

And here, is a quote from Google on their (current) favorite definition of what ML actually *is*: 

> ML is a way to get predictive insights from data to make repeated decisions. You do this using algorithms that are relatively general and applicable to a wide variety of datasets.

Figure 1 shows where ML fits in with business analytics and decision making.  Effectively, data gleaned from various sources can be acted upon (in various ways, depending on the needs of the business).  Typically such activities would be done via data warehousing (see the section on BigQuery if you jumped ahead), however we can use (semi-)intelligent algorithms to go further.

Typically with ML, you develop the algorithm that learns *how* to make decisions rather than hard-coding a decision making strategy yourself.  In this section we'll be taking a look at how to do that.  Here are a couple of quotes from Google on the topic:

> Think of a typical company and how they use their data today. Perhaps they have a dashboard that business analysts and decision-makers view on a daily basis? Perhaps a report that they read on a monthly basis? That’s an example of backward-looking use of data -- looking at historical data to create reports and dashboards. This is what people tend to mean when they talk about business intelligence. A lot of data analytics is backward-looking. Instead we will use ML to generate forward looking or predictive insights. 

> Of course, the point of looking at historical data might be to make decisions. Perhaps business analysts examine the data and suggest new policies or rules? They suggest, for example, that it might be possible to raise the price of a product in a certain region. Now, the business analyst is making a predictive insight, but is that scalable? Can the business analyst make such a decision for every product in every region? Can they dynamically adjust the price every second?

> In order to make decisions around predictive insights repeatable, you need ML. You need a computer program deriving such insights. So, ML is about making many predictive decisions from data. It’s about scaling up business intelligence and decision making.

Figure 2 (c/o Google) demonstrates some of the other typical examples of how ML can be applied.  Note: it doesn't need to simply be for business decisions!  We can use it for everyday tasks such as mapping routes or picking what movie to watch.

The general concept with ML is that you typically develop and train a model that is intended to make decisions about, well, *something*.  The tricky thing with ML are that (1) models can be quite difficult, (2) your decisions are only as good as the data you train the model on, and (3) automated tools can make our lives much easier.

> NOTE: One thing to **really** consider when performing ML is that you really need to understand what it is doing!  A simple example would be a video recommendation algorithm gone awry -- imagine a child watching a series of age-appropriate videos only to be recommended something graphic (i.e., way beyond what they're ready for) as a result of a poorly-trained/defined model.  Treat ML as you would treat any other program -- it must be demonstratably and verifiably correct.

I've mentioned a model several times now, but what *is* a model?  Generally, you'll have some concept of how to perform a task, whether it is taxes/mapping as in the prior figure, or making decisions based on meta-data tagged on videos you've previously watched.  What a model does is *learn* based on historical data (more or less -- some models don't necessarily need a lot of historical data) and then make decisions based on what has been previously interpreted.  

Let's walk through a *typical* ML strategy: training and testing.  The simplest example *trains* a model with a large set of the dataset that is available, and then the model is *tested* with the remaining dataset.  In this approach, we can generally tell if a decision made during the *testing* phase is correct or not, and if the decisions were incorrect they can be fed back into the process for "fixing" our model.  

Figure X (c/o Google) shows two simple examples of this concept (i.e., training a model).  If you want to make tax-related decisions, you will need historical tax information.  The same goes for map-related problems (fasted trip time, etc.).  You'll need historical data to know what has worked in the past.  Effectively, the model learns prior successful strategies and applies that knowledge to future decisions.
