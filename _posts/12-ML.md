## Machine Learning

Just as a precursor/forewarning: *this is not an in-depth guide to machine learning (ML) or artificial intelligence*!  We're going to use the tools available to us in Google Cloud, but for a deep dive into ML theory you'll probably want to take a whole class or post-graduate program on it.

Enough preamble, on we go!

### Machine Learning Basics

This is my favorite image related to machine learning, bar none (c/o CloudSight):

To you, clearly they are all muffins.  (joking).  But a machine learning algorithm might have a hard time telling the difference!  What about a traffic light covered in snow?  Or the side of a semi-truck that an algorithm recognizes as sky (see: Tesla disasters).
