# CIS655 - Cloud Application Development

Course repository for CIS655 - Cloud Application Development at Grand Valley State University

## About

CIS655 is a fifteen-week asynchronous-online course at [Grand Valley State University](https://www.gvsu.edu) for cloud applications development.  Given its asynchronous state, I've made all the course materials open source to benefit the cloud education community.  All materials and labs will be performed on the [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/).

> Naturally, I will only be marking up assignments for students registered in the course.  If you have questions on the material or want to learn how to use GCP in your classroom please feel free to contact me or my [friends at Google Cloud's education wing](https://edu.google.com/products/google-cloud/).

> Additionally, please note that our Blackboard page is your home for **all** deadlines! 

As a heads up, the videos were initially recorded in 2020 and I have updated/added/edited where necessary.  Google (and other cloud providers) have a habit of updating their interfaces as often as humanly possible.  If you discover a video (that I have missed) please let me know.

## Prerequisites

This course has no official prereqs other than a willingness to learn new technologies quickly (five-week course!).  However, there are a few languages/environments I'll be using that you may wish to familiarize yourselves with.

### Python

I will do all code examples in Python as that is my (current) language of choice.  Fortunately, most of the GCP technologies we'll be using have code examples in several other languages.  I will highlight those as we go.  Here is a [Beginner's Guide to Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide) if you'd like a quick start.

### Bash

For interacting with GCP, I'll be using a Linux bash terminal on my local machine (Ubuntu for Windows).  The [`Cloud Shell`](https://cloud.google.com/shell/) that is a large part of the GCP platform also uses bash.  Effectively, you shouldn't be afraid of Linux commands.  Here is a [quick start guide](https://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/Bash-Beginners-Guide.pdf).

For what it's worth, you could also use PowerShell to interact with GCP, however that interaction would be left as an exercise to the student.

## Cloud Credits

If you are registered for the course at GVSU, **YOU DO NOT NEED TO PAY FOR CLOUD CREDITS**.  **DO NOT ENTER A CREDIT CARD**.  You should have received an email from me (via Blackboard) at the start of class with a coupon, and if you end up running out I can get more credits for you.

If you are not registered, you're on your own.  Sorry.  Check the [Introduction](https://gvsu-cloudapplicationsdevelopment.github.io/CloudAppsDev/2020/12/27/class-structure.html) content for more information.
